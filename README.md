# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) design pattern in [insert your programming language or framework here]. CQRS separates the concerns of read and write operations, allowing for the optimization of each model independently. 

## Features

- **Command Query Separation:** Clearly distinguishes between operations that read data and those that modify data, leading to a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
- **Improved Scalability:** Optimizes read and write operations separately, allowing for better scaling of the application components.
- **Performance Enhancement:** Enables the use of different models for read and write operations, improving the overall performance of the application.
- **Flexible Domain Models:** Provides flexibility in managing complex domain models by utilizing separate models for different operations.
